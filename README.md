# Orbitron

ðŸš€ **Orbitron** is a video calling platform with **in-app centralized session recording**.  
No more local screen recordings or manual uploads â€” every peerâ€™s stream (video/audio/screen) is recorded **server-side** and automatically processed into a final synced video.

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Solved
In normal video calls, if a session is important:  
- Someone has to screen record locally  
- Handle storage  
- Upload manually  

Orbitron automates this process â€” the server handles recording, post-processing, and uploading so all participants can access the recording easily.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Multi-peer video calling (beta supports up to 5 peers per call)  
- Server-side recording for all streams (video, audio, screen share)  
- Automatic post-processing via **FFmpeg**  
- Dashboard for participants to access recordings  
- Desktop & laptop support (mobile coming soon)
